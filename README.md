# Clojure-Resources
Compilation of useful resources for learning Clojure

To Aggregate resources to learn and understand Clojure (and LISP in general).

[WIP] I will keep updating as i find new resources (My only rule is to understand the resource before putting it here).

##Clojure
* [Clojure Homepage](http://clojure.org/).


##LISP
* [Lisp: It's Not About Macros, It's About Read](http://jlongster.com/Lisp--It-s-Not-About-Macros,-It-s-About-Read).
